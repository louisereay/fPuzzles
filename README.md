Kittiaara's user scripts for F-Puzzles

F-Puzzles is a sudoku sharing website used by a large number of puzzle setters and particularly
popular in the Cracking The Cryptic puzzle community.

The website itself is no longer being developed, so these scripts are designed to expand the 
functionality of the site to incorporate new styles of Sudoku puzzle.
